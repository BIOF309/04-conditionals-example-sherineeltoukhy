This is my conditionals assignment. I used the twitter csv file. I got the descriptive statistics for favored tweets and retweets by state.
Then I created a function to return values of high, medium, or low for each row based on the actual values in tweets favored and retweeted.
Then finally, I got the frequencies for the high, medium, low categories per state.
